## Maze Generator and Solver

This is a simple console app that I made for fun that generates a random maze and then solves it.

The solver uses Depth First Search and the generator uses a very similar algorithm called [Recursive Backtracking](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking)

## To Run

Install [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)

```bash
dotnet run
```
